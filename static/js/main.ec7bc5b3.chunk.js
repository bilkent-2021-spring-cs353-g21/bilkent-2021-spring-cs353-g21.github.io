Why We Need to Use a Database ",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"For a food delivery system to function well, it needs data. The most basic functionality of a food delivery system is to deliver food. In order to deliver food, we need to know which customer ordered the food, where and when, which items constitute in the order, what the status of the order is, and so on. Besides these basic functionalities, many other functionalities, such as allowing customers to store multiple addresses and phones with additional descriptions, a review system, a friends list, and chat, will be implemented. All of these functionalities constitute a huge amount of data, and this data needs to be read and modified by many users at the same time. The proposed web application also needs to be able to search for data and sort data when required and needs to do this rapidly with ease. Considering future updates, this data structure should be able to be modified easily. Algorithms that prevent data redundancy and inconsistency, that can easily access data, and that allows consistency constraints are required to maintain this huge amount of data. Furthermore, different types of users such as customers, the restaurant manager, and delivery guys should be given different types of access to the data stored; therefore, we need a system to which security constraints can be enforced easily. All of these considered, it is obviously most convenient to use a database system.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{})," ",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"2. How We Will Be Using the Database ",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"The database that will be implemented in this project will be used mostly to keep track of the customers and the restaurants from which they can order, as well as the orders themselves, including the items and the delivery guy. Certain parts of the database are to be modified frequently as the users register accounts and rapidly order different meals from different registered restaurants. Alternatively, certain parts of the database will see very infrequent modification as the list of registered restaurants will not be modified every day.",Object(c.jsx)("br",{})," ",Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),"For the information which will be displayed, some portions of the database will be visible to all users, such as the restaurants that will be displayed.
